#JSONâ€“from the web to Python
#Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API programmatically in Python and printed the text of the response to the shell. 
#However, as you know, your response is actually a JSON, so you can do one step better and decode the JSON.
#You can then print the key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's what you're going to do now!




# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])
